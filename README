This directory contains a set of ADCP-related libraries and utilities
written and copyrighted by A.M. Thurnherr. The software is written in
perl (V5.12.4 or later should work) and assumed to run in a UN*X
environment.

To find out which version you have, run "make" in current directory.

Most of the source files use a hard tab of 4 spaces, i.e. they can be
viewed correctly, e.g. with "less -x4".

There is currently very little documentation for this software, nor is
there any support. The libraries are required for the re-implemented
shear method (Thurnherr, J. Tech. 2012), for the vertical-velocity
method (Thurnherr, IEEE 2011), and for processing LADCP data with
external attitude (Thurnherr et al., J. Tech., 2017).

THIS SOFTWARE CAN BE FREELY USED AND COPIED FOR EDUCATIONAL OR OTHER
NOT-FOR-PROFIT PURPOSES.
