This directory contains a set of ADCP-related libraries and utilities
written and copyrighted by A.M. Thurnherr. The software is written in
perl (V5.12.4 or later should work) and assumed to run in a UN*X
environment.

To find out which version you have, run "make" in current directory.

Most of the source files use a hard tab of 4 spaces, i.e. they can be
viewed correctly, e.g. with "less -x4".

There is currently no documentation, nor is there support. Some of the
libraries are required for the re-implemented shear method (Thurnherr,
J. Techo. 2012) and for the vertical-velocity method (Thurnherr, IEEE
2011).

SOFTWARE CAN BE FREELY USED AND COPIED FOR EDUCATIONAL OR OTHER
NOT-FOR-PROFIT PURPOSES.
